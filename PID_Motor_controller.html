    <h3> Senior Design Project: ECE 4534</h2>
        <h2>by Jasher Grunau</h2>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p> A rover must be able to coordinate itself enough while moving to deliver it's package to a certain location. The given motors are low quality and yeild lots of error. To correct enough of this error, while keeping the system stable, a PID (Proportional
        Integral Derivative) Controller is created and tuned accurately enough so that the rover will consistently reach its coordinates within a +/- 1cm error, every 30cm of travel. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This project takes place in a class called <i>Embedded Systems Design</i>, which is a capstone class for Computer Engineering students at Virginia Tech. All students are grouped into 4's, and we're each given a board that we must learn to use
            effectively. After lots of planning and paperwork, we plan out our long team project. We each had to implement a board and the team must use a server. My professor personally issued me a challenge to create the entire server myself. Asking
            him why I should double my workload, he simply said "well it'd look good on a resume." Good enough for me. Aside from that, I was in charge of configuring my board to operate a motor system for traversing a rover in a specified path of travel.
            In total, I yielded two senior design projects:
            <ol>
                <li>The Server system and</li>
                <li>The Motor system</li>
            </ol>
            This page is about <b>#2: The Motor System</b>.</p>
