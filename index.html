		<h2>General Software Engineer<span>Aalta.io</span></h2>
		<p>I work for a super small start-up software company that's trying to take off. I am fulfilling many different roles and work very flexibly to meet new demands that are often changing. We work with a frequently pivoting roadmap. I don't feel like I know what I'm doing most of the time tbh...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fill many roles as needed, such as Software Developer, Software Architect, Project Lead, and Business Analyst.</li>
			<li>Help with RFP responses, solutioning, and paperwork as an under-qualified software architect.</li>
			<li>Coordinate with subcontracted foreign development teams</li>
			<li>Be a project lead with smaller projects and oversee interns</li>
			<li>Develop product roadmaps using various approaches</li>
			<li>Perform various research tasks for future product iterations and make cost-benefit analysis</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2>Crude A.I. for Market Prediction<span>Personal Project</span></h2>
		<p>Use unorthodox algorithms to make a self-learning bot to predict relational inflation and deflation of currencies around the world. It basically models a future of the Foreign Exchange Market based on data gathered in the past. As the system gathers more data, it may become more accurate and may be a useful assistance to making wise financial investments in the future</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mine data by sampling API and WebScrapping</li>
			<li>Extract data from public documents with multiple acclimated parsers</li>
			<li>Store data onto a MySQL Database (using MariaDB)</li>
			<li>Multi-thread the project environment and use FICO Queues to simulate multiple clients for future integration</li>
			<li>Quantify market predicting methods into a system controller to be scale-able actions that can be tuned</li>
			<li>Compare technique to a Time-series Convolutional NN application (in progress)
			<li>Simulate the market to be an accurate reflection of reality while also making success measurable in that market</li>
			<li>Design a visually helpful GUI to show the system processes for diagnostics and debugging</li>
			<li>Visually model numerical results to help understand what predictive methods work best and possibly reveal <em>why</em> those methods are successful</li>
			<li>Automate self optimization for a self-learning ability</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>P.I.D. Embedded Systems Controller <span>Capstone Project</span></h2>
		<p>P.I.D. is simply a design in the field of systems engineering. In robotics, there is inevitably a cross over with system design when software interacts with real-time mechanics and operates under real-time constraints on embedded computer systems. In the feedback loop between my written software and the motor system in my rover robot, there are inconsistencies with response and a significant delay in the feedback. Correcting error in the environment in an efficient manner can be really difficult without leading to system instability. For example, my rover would literally shake and tremble when attempting to travel because my software was rapidly over-correcting itself with delayed path reading. This problem was solved with a formal systems engineering method, and after researching and reading "PID without a PhD," I employed the Proportional Integral Derivative controller. <a href="https://jasherg7.github.io/PID_motor_controller"> Project Page</a></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tune my rover's motor systems to consistently reach its coordinates with no more than +/- 1.0 cm error, every 30.0 cm of travel.</li>
			<li>Develop an embedded system on a PIC32 board with C programming and FreeRTOS</li>
			<li>Design low-level TCP communication to communicate with other Team members' PICs and my designed server system.</li>
			<li>Change P, I, and D constants in the embedded system through server communication for efficient debugging and testing.</li>
			<li>Send motor error real time to the server, and plot the error over time to see how to monitor the stability of the system.</li>
			<li>Use the stability plots to tune the PID control system via the PID constants on the server.</li>
		</ul>
                
		<h2>Reverse Proxy Server <span> Capstone Project</span></h2>
		<p>A server system must to be able to connect with 5 clients and communicate via a customized network protocol in order to read and write information in a database.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Design network communication protocol unique to our embedded systems</li>
			<li>Create Reverse proxy server to establish connection with clients, multi thread communications, parse network packets, and process information</li>
			<li>Implement Flask server and communicate with the reverse proxy server via HTTP requests</li>
			<li>Make a MongoDB API, and use it as a database within the Flask Server</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Cloud-based Data Mining Network <span>In Progress...</span></h2>
		<p>My personal server has a problem with data loss whenever my home loses power or whenever there are inconsistencies in my internet service. To have consistency in my data collection, I am migrating my data mining processes off of my server and onto the Google Cloud (and possibly onto others that offer free services). Each of the multiple micro cloud computers will be coordinating with my personal server to store all of the data onto a single, shared data pool. The pool stores onto the MySQL Database also running on my server.</p>

		<h2>Data Processing Android Network <span>In Progress...</span></h2>
		<p>To save money in computer processing, I am designing a universal Android app to coordinate multiple scrap phones into a shared network. The android app will share the computing tasks among every client among the network, divvying out the processing among them. The measured success of each is stored back in the server's database for later Machine Learning analysis.</p>

		<h2>Computer Vision Team<span> RoboGrinder (Robomasters) </span></h2>
		<p>RoboGrinder is Virginia Tech's competitive robot team, primarily focused on the annual international robot battle competition: <em>Robomaster</em>. It's held during the summers in Shenzhen, China, and hosted by <em>DJI</em>. My team's website can be found <a href="https://www.robogrinder.com/"> here</a>. The Computer Vision team of RoboGrinder is responsible to the autonomous functions of the robots in the compition. Specifically we focus on image processing for our robots' guns and turrets to automatically target enemies without the use of a pilot.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Design image processing and object detection software with OpenCV library.</li>
			<li>Work on team with a massive language barrier</li>
			<li>Document trips and handle technical writing to sponsors</li>
		</ul>
