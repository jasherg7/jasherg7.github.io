		<h2>Computer Vision for Robot Navigation and Combat<span> Robomasters</span></h2>
		<p>Developed an image processing software in an international robot team called <em>RoboGrinder</em> primarily focused on a Chinese competition called <em>Robomasters</em> hosted by <em>DJI</em> in Shenzhen, China.  I worked on the software subteam, where we focused on Computer Vision. Specifically we focused on image processing for our robots' guns and turrets to automatically target enemies without the use of a pilot and it's navigation around the field. My team's website can be found <a href="https://www.robogrinder.com/"> here</a>.<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Design the image processing feed of our robots to auto-detect and target our enemy robots with our turret gun.</li>

    			<li>Implement a Flood-Fill algorithm for object detection of that filtered image feed</li>
    			<li>Train our turrets to target special locations in a separate competition mini-game (hosted in Quebec). Trained with Tensorflow library and Machine Learning techniques</li>
    			<li>Work on team with a massive language barrier</li>
    			<li>Document trips and handle technical writing to sponsors</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>P.I.D. Embedded Systems Controller <span>Capstone Project</span></h2>
		<p>P.I.D. is simply a design in the field of systems engineering. In robotics, there is inevitably a cross over with system design when software interacts with real-time mechanics and operates under real-time constraints on embedded computer systems. In the feedback loop between my written software and the motor system in my rover robot, there are inconsistencies with response and a significant delay in the feedback. Correcting error in the environment in an efficient manner can be really difficult without leading to system instability. For example, my rover would literally shake and tremble when attempting to travel because my software was rapidly over-correcting itself with delayed path reading. This problem was solved with a formal systems engineering method, and after researching and reading "PID without a PhD," I employed the Proportional Integral Derivative controller. <a href="https://jasherg7.github.io/PID_motor_controller"> Project Page</a></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tune my rover's motor systems to consistently reach its coordinates with no more than +/- 1.0 cm error, every 30.0 cm of travel.</li>
			<li>Develop an embedded system on a PIC32 board with C programming and FreeRTOS</li>
			<li>Design low-level TCP communication to communicate with other Team members' PICs and my designed server system.</li>
			<li>Change P, I, and D constants in the embedded system through server communication for efficient debugging and testing.</li>
			<li>Send motor error real time to the server, and plot the error over time to see how to monitor the stability of the system.</li>
			<li>Use the stability plots to tune the PID control system via the PID constants on the server.</li>
		</ul>
                
		<h2>Reverse Proxy Server <span> Capstone Project</span></h2>
		<p>A server system must to be able to connect with 5 clients and communicate via a customized network protocol in order to read and write information in a database.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Design network communication protocol unique to our embedded systems</li>
			<li>Create Reverse proxy server to establish connection with clients, multi thread communications, parse network packets, and process information</li>
			<li>Implement Flask server and communicate with the reverse proxy server via HTTP requests</li>
			<li>Make a MongoDB API, and use it as a database within the Flask Server</li>
		</ul>	
				
                <h2>2D Game Engine<span>Senior Design Project</span></h2>
		<p>This is <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Time</em> created by <strong>Jasher Grunau</strong> and <strong>Alex Laisney</strong> as a senior design project. To have a functioning game, I needed to build and design a game engine. It’s design was meticulous and difficult. It's performance is atrocious because our class's development platform doesn't allow us to store custom sprites in cache or in memory. Meaning each sprite is manually being regenerated many times a second. I am working on fixing it with a better platform that will migrate the code well. In the meantime, play the current version displayed below or <a href="https://jasherg7.github.io/game"> click here</a>></p>

		<h2>MIPS Assembly Simulator <span>Class Design Project</span></h2>
		<p>Large individual project to simulate the MIPS Assembly compiler and its code execution.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Code in C++, while using Git and CMAKE for the project management</li>
			<li>Create robust unit testing for 100% code coverage</li>
			<li>Write language parser for MIPS assembly language </li>
			<li>Use object-oriented design for command executions previously parsed</li>
			<li>Manually allocate memory in C++ and fix any measured memory leakage </li>
			<li>Design a UI using the Qt graphics library for an easier access for clients</li>
			<li>Multi-thread environment and measure increased program execution speed</li>
